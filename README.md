# Hi there! 
I'm Giulia, a digital and innovation consultant with over eight years of experience. I've worked with a variety of clients across industries, helping them navigate the complexities of digital transformation.

My academic background includes an M.A. in Marketing and an Executive Program in Innovation & Digital Transformation. This, combined with my previous studies in art history, gives me a unique perspective on blending creativity with strategic thinking.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through sports and personal growth activities like reading, exploring creative outlets, and mindfulness practices.

I'm currently based in Hannover and working as a digital consultant at ZÃ¼hlke.
